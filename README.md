### Become a DATA ANALYST [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGx1QNdYzvs&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=1) 

Database Creation:
[Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=3) 

Start from basic SELECT statements. Learn group by, joins, unions.

Then, go all the way up to subqueries, CTEs, stored procedures, window functions, temp tables.

Finally, end with trigggers and events.

Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis projects have comments to explain what's going on.

Overall this was a really good experience. 

After this, I switched to data analyst roadmap on [Analyst Builder](https://www.analystbuilder.com/)
